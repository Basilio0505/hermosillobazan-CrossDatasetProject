Note the incident table currently doesn't have a valid primary key. we will be working on it using beam.

After expanding our Date table from dataset2 by seperating month, day and year columns
through beam (currently imposible through bigquery), we will be able to use it to join 
to dataset1 and compare the rate or increase/decrease of storms and wild fires over 
time leading up to 2012 (not inclusive) to see if it could back up the hysteria behind 
the 2012 end of the world myth durring that period. We would use a join for joining Date
and Incidents tables from dataset2 and use a join for Date and Storm Events from dataset1 
then outer join those two to get our results. Using aggregate queries such as count or 
add to see the increase in damage caused by the events group by month of the year.

We can also use the same tables to find the change between the different years using the 
same type of transforms used to find the results over months but now group the aggregate 
query results by years instead of months.

After expanding our State table from dataset2 by adding state names and/or state_fips
through beam we will be able to use it to join to dataset1. As of instances while both 
string they come in a different format, (e.g., California vs CA). Once this data discrepancy 
has been taken care of, we will be able to see  rate and/or the amount of damage from events 
per state. We would join State and StormEvents tables from dataset1 and outer join that to a 
join of State and Incidents  table from dataset 2 and use aggregate queries such as count or 
add to see the differences between states.
