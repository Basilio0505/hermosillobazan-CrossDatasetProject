Formatting issues in data:
 
storm_events_modeled.Locations: data under cz_name has inconsistent capitalization in county names causing 
				duplicate data where one county is fully capitalized and the other is lower 
				case. In addition, final spaces in some records are causing inconsistencies. 
          
storm_events_modeled.StormEvent: cz_fips and state_fips could be joinned into one single element to give specify a location.


WildLand_Incidents_modeled.Incidents: Create a primary key and turn date from INTEGER to DATE type. 

WildLand_Incidents_modeled.State: Reformat State IDs to match the other dataset and add fips as well. 

WildLand_Incidents_modeled.Date: Create a primary key as date and separate month, year and day.
