For our project, we would like to explore whether storms and other weather phenomena correlate with an increase or decrease in
flight delays in the United States. For our main dataset, we decided to choose Storm Events by the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found at https://public.enigma.com/browse/collection/national-climatic-weather-center-storm-events/3d0d8bdf-b885-48b9-a3b1-8a8441fc0131. 
The files are separated by years starting from 1996 to 2000 with the same 61 attributes, the size ranges from approximately 
30,000 records to up to 80,000 records. This dataset provides information about storms and other weather phenomena including 
floods, tornados and record temperatures. The dataset also provides information about life losses, injuries, significant property
damage, and disruption to commerce. For the beginning of our project we will be looking at how different weather patterns occur 
across the country, for instance, are storms more prominent on the east coast or the west coast? what about tornadoes? What are 
the most affected states by these weather phenomena?

Here is a small sample from the Storm Events dataset:

For our second dataset we chose to analyse wild land incidents data provided by the National Fire Incident Reporting System 
of the U.S Government's Federal Emergency Management Agency.
available at: https://public.enigma.com/browse/collection/nfirs-wild-land-incidents/952d1599-65cc-4374-afa8-b07f6cdb2f98
With this data we want to compare damages of land and date of occurance from this dataset to ou primary one and find any correlation
between types of storm events to the amount of damage done. We plan on using the date of the events as a key to join the datasets.

We are looking at the years 2010 amd 2011 to compare since 2012 and 2013 schemas drastically change. We could also look into the rise in storms
and fires and their damage leading up the 2012 end of the world paranoia durring that time period.
